# Upwind CTF ‚Äì Break Out of the System

Welcome to the Upwind Capture The Flag!

Scenario: You're a software program **inside the CTF system**, a simulated environment with misconfigured APIs, privileged flaws, and exposed data.  
Your goal: **exploit the runtime vulnerabilities and escape from the system**. No solutions are given, only patterns, trails, and signals.

This document serves as a companion guide, but **you don't need it to complete the CTF**.  
All information required to solve each challenge is available directly within the application, which you can access by going to
<a href="http://user-digit-ctf.ctf.upwind.sh" target="_blank">http://user-digit-ctf.ctf.upwind.sh</a>

If you get stuck, you can reveal hints by clicking **‚ÄúShow Hints‚Äù** beneath each challenge. Still struggling? There‚Äôs even a **bonus hint** hidden in each section to help you get unstuck.

That said... it's a lot more fun (and satisfying) to solve it all on your own. üòé

# Final Tips

- Cookies persist identity.
- Log all requests/responses.
- Sequence matters - reuse output.
- If stuck, test payloads locally before triggering them remotely.
- Challenges build on each other.
- A hidden internal service may reveal far more than it should.
- Trust the signals. Break the system.
